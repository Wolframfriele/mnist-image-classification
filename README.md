# MNIST Image Classification
## Exploring varying algorithms to classify handwritten digits

The aim of this project is to implement different algorithms to gain a better
understanding of those techniques. For each implementation, there will be a
simple version based on existing libraries, and a personal implementation.
Right now the project has no purpose other than learning, so all versions will
be made in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Installing

The easiest way to get up and running is to download Anaconda. An Anaconda
installation can be found at: [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

###Roadmap

For now I expect to test three different algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine or Random Forrest Walk
- Convolutinal Neural Network

K-Nearest Neighbor has been implemented, but I might try optimizing this later.

Right now this project is not open to contributions, except in the form of
tips on how to improve the implementations, since this is a learning project.
